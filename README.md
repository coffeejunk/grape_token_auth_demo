#GrapeTokenAuth demo

This repo is indended to demonstrate the [grape_token_auth][grape_token_auth]
gem and how it can be setup to interact with [ng-token-auth][ng-token-auth].

The Rails twin to this repo is [devise_token_auth_demo][devise_token_auth_demo].
It is currently up on [heroku here][heroku_demo] using
[ng-token-auth][ng-token-auth] for the front end. The only change to the test
app code base is the backend url. Github is currently the only omniauth provider
active, but obviously others are possible.
